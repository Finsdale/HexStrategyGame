When setting up the project on a new machine, you will need to build the ControllerInput in an adjacent project.
run this from the command line:
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-mgcb-editor --version 3.8.0.1641
additionally, make sure that you have .Net 3.1 installed (it is not installed by default)

I'm not sure if it is necessary, but I have also installed the: DirectX End-User Runtimes (June 2010)
